# Babel
Babel is a Discord bot that enables speech-to-speech real-time translation in your Discord server.

Just invite Babel, join a voice channel, and type the /join command to start translating into your desired language.

Other users will hear you through the bot's audio, so ask them to mute your mic!

If you want to translate the input you're receiving as well, create two instances of the bot and ask the other person to invoke the /join command.

Enjoy seamless real-time translation!
